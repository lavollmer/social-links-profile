# Social Links Profile Website

This project involved creating a replica of a social links profile website, adhering strictly to a provided design. The challenge was to match the design 1:1 without any additional guidance on the code or frameworks to be used. The primary technologies leveraged for this project were ReactJS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and Vite.

This is a solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

The project's scope involved developing a social links profile website page using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Vite. I was provided with a collection of assets, including design examples, images, and fonts. The image was provided was of the profile page individual. The fonts used were from Google Fonts. The website featured a profile picture, the individual's name and location, a quote about them and five button links to various social media pages. The project required a precise understanding of tailwindCSS, flex box and design.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Mobile responsive design
- Color combination match to design presented
- User's profile picture displayed
- User's name, location and quote displayed

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) - This Google Font was the required font for the project. I used this and embedded it in my head of my index html as well as my Tailwind config file.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
