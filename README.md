# Social Links Profile Website

This project involved creating a replica of a social links profile website, adhering strictly to a provided design. The challenge was to match the design 1:1 without any additional guidance on the code or frameworks to be used. The primary technologies leveraged for this project were ReactJS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, and Vite.

This is a solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

The project's scope involved developing a social links profile website page using ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and Vite. I was provided with a collection of assets, including design examples, images, and fonts. The image was provided was of the profile page individual. The fonts used were from Google Fonts. The website featured a profile picture, the individual's name and location, a quote about them and five button links to various social media pages. The project required a precise understanding of tailwindCSS, flex box and design.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Mobile responsive design
- Color combination match to design presented
- User's profile picture displayed
- User's name, location and quote displayed
